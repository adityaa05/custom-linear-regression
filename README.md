# Simple Linear Regression From Scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement **Simple Linear Regression** from scratch in Python without using libraries like `sklearn` for modeling. It's designed for beginners who want to understand the core concepts behind linear regression models.

## 🔍 What This Project Covers

- Understanding the relationship between **Years of Experience** and **Salary**
- Creating visualizations to explore the dataset
- Deriving the line of best fit manually using:
  - **Closed-form solution (Ordinary Least Squares)**
  - **Gradient Descent**
- Evaluating the model using error metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- Comparing predicted vs actual values
- Visualizing the trained model

## 📝 Dataset Description

The dataset used contains:

- `YearsExperience` (independent variable - X)
- `Salary` (dependent variable - y)

It’s a small dataset made to demonstrate how a simple regression line is fitted.

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- Scatter plots of the data
- Line of best fit
- Comparisons between good fit and bad fit lines
